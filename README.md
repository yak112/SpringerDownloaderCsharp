# SpringerDownloaderCsharp
A simple downloader for Springer free books written in C#.


This downloader was created with the purpose to download the collection of free books published by Springer in Spring 2020.
It is written in C# using OpenXML libraries.
To work, this program only needs a path to download the books. If there is a Epub version of the book it will download it aswell.


THANKS SPRINGER!
